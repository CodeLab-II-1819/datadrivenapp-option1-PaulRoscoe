# CodeLab II (CCO5000-20)
## Data Driven Application Option 1 - Assignment 2

### Task

For this assignment you are asked to develop an application that interrogates tweets. The application should be designed to use functions and pass arguments between these as appropriate. Where possible the application should also implement object oriented programming techniques. 

To complete the assignment you should utilise the ‘sampleTweets’ file that contains a set of tweets from the top 20 users on Twitter. Your program must provide a minimum of 10 sample queries that should include: 

Count the total number of tweets in the data set
Count the number of tweets that mention the word money. 
Count the number of tweets that mention politics. 
Print to the screen any tweets mentioning the word “Paris” 
Print to the screen any tweets mentioning the word “DreamWorks” 
Print to the screen any tweets mentioning the word “Uber”. 
Plus a minimum of 4 queries of your own. 

The final application can either query and display tweets via the console or via a GUI window.

You should use the file name sampleTweets for the file of tweets. Any other name will lead to a penalty 10 marks being deducted.


### Guides

A series of guides are provided in the guides folder. These include guides on cloning this repository to your local machine and placing the sampleTweets file in the correct location.

### Deliverables

The deliverables for the Data Driven Application are as follows:

#### The Application

The C++ code (e.g. main.cpp file) and any supplementary files required to run your data driven application. These files should be committed to your unique github repository for this assignment. 

*If you are unsure - ask!*

#### The Development Document

Your data driven application must be accompanied by a Development Document of a minimum of 1000 words (there is no maximum word count). This development document should consist of the following elements: Abstract, Project Plan, Evidence of design, Technical Description, Testing, Critical Reflection, Appendix (see brief for full details).

The development document should be submitted via Turnitin and include the assignement coversheet as the first page. The coversheet should include a link to your Github repository. 

*Incorrect submission will result in marks being deducted.*
